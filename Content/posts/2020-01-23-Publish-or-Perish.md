I don't post on here much, but I really wanted to try  [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) by John Sundell to replace Jekyll. I love it so far and I'm working on building my own theme called 'Empire' based on the included 'Foundation' one.  It's on [github](https://github.com/jamiejenkins/jamiejenkins.com) if you want to see how it looks under the hood. 

Update: I've mostly completed replicating my old Jekyll site.
