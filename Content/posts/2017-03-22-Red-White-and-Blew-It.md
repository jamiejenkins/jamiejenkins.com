So, Apple released a [Red iPhone](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/special-edition-iphone-7) yesterday. The first picture I saw was the back of the 2 sizes and I started thinking to myself that maybe I could go red for my next iPhone. Then I saw the front. White. WHY?

**Update:** Apple released new [iPhone 8 & 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/04/apple-introduces-iphone-8-and-iphone-8-plus-productred-special-edition/) today.  And they made the front of it black! Nice!

**Update 2:** [iPhone 11 Pro Midnight Green!](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/) I went with the Space Grey but I really like the green - hoping for Midnight Blue next year!

**Update 3:** So many color choices for [iPhone 12 Pro](https://www.apple.com/iphone-12-pro/) and [iPhone 12](https://www.apple.com/iphone-12/)! I went with the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro Max and really like the iPhone 12 Blue as well!

**Update 6** Back in Black! New iPhone 14 Pro Max Space Black with Black Leather Case.  Maybe I should have went with Deep Purple instead...
