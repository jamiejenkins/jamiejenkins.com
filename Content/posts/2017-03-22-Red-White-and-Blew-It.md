So, Apple released a [Red iPhone](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/special-edition-iphone-7) yesterday. The first picture I saw was the back of the 2 sizes and I started thinking to myself that maybe I could go red for my next iPhone. Then I saw the front. White. WHY? 
👎🏻

**Update:** Apple released new [iPhone 8 & 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/04/apple-introduces-iphone-8-and-iphone-8-plus-productred-special-edition/) today.  And they made the front of it black! Nice!
